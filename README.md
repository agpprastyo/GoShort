# GoShort

GoShort is URL shortener service built with Go. This project demonstrates my expertise in backend development, API design, frontend.

## Features

- 🚀 **Fast & Efficient**: Built with [Fiber](https://gofiber.io/) for low-latency HTTP handling.
- 🗄️ **PostgreSQL**: Robust data storage.
- 🔒 **Security**: JWT authentication, Basic Auth for sensitive endpoints, and environment-based configuration.
- 🧪 **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests.
- 📚 **API Documentation**: Swagger UI with protected access.
- 🛠️ **Clean Architecture**: Modular codebase for maintainability and scalability.
- 🖥️ **Frontend**: React-based UI for easy link management (if applicable).

## Tech Stack

- **Go** (Fiber, SQLC)
- **PostgreSQL** (primary database)
- **React** (frontend)
- **Docker** (containerization)
- **Swagger** (API docs)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Use Go 1.24**  
   - Make sure you have Go 1.24 installed.
